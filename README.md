# Data Science References

A repository for (mostly) plain-English explanations and example code for various topics that fall under the "Data Science" umbrella. Code and write ups are meant to be a personal reference as I learn topics, then explore and test the Python Data Science stack's functionality.

** Topics **

- [Statististics and Probability for Data Science](./Statistics_and_Probability/StatisticsAndProbability.ipynb)
- [Machine Learning Overview](./Machine_Learning/MachineLearningOverview.ipynb)
- [Example Data Visualizations and Exploratory Data Analysis](./Visualization_and_EDA/VisualizationsAndEDA.ipynb)
- [Example Machine Learning Pipeline](./Project_Steps/Full_Pipeline_Example.ipynb)
