    "# Statistics and Probability for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "The work done in the name of data science has roots in various fields, including computer science, mathematics, and statistics. Broadly speaking, **statistics** involves collecting and analyzing data to find useful information, with the goal of making decisions based off that knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major areas in the field of statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Descriptive statistics**, which covers collecting and organizing data and usually performing general calculations to measure central tendency and variability (or spread) of that data\n",
    "2. **Inferential statistics**, which are procedures to understand relationships, draw conclusions, or make predictions about a population based on sample data from that population\n",
    "\n",
    "A **population** is the set of all measurements of interest, and a number describing a population is a **parameter**. A **sample** is any small group of individuals or objects selected to represent the entire group (the population), where a number describing a sample is a **statistic**. Often, the population parameters are unknown, hence the need to use sample data to make inferences about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of inferential statistics techniques rely on **probability theory**, which is a branch of mathematics that's concerned with calculating the likelihood of outcomes of experiments. In other words, it's the science of uncertainty."

    "Before diving into each field, it's important to understand the different **types of data** out there. Generally, it can be qualitative or quantitative, each with further sub-categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantitative Data**: numeric observations, such as height, the number of classes a student is enrolled in, or the percentage of households with pets by city. This can be further broken down into either discrete or continuous data\n",
    "- **Qualitative Data**: observations that are non-numeric attributes, such as gender, the mode of transportation a person takes, or the type of material something is made of. Also referred to as **categorical** data\n",
    "- **Discrete Numerical Data**: a subset of quantitative data, where you are able to *count* the possible values (think integers), such as the number of people who contracted the flu this year\n",
    "- **Continuous Numerical Data**: a subset of quantitative data, where you aren't able to count the possible values (think decimals - usually the result of a measurement that can take on any real number). An example is the fluid ounces of coffee you drink each morning\n",
    "- **Ordinal Data**: qualitative or categorical data that has an inherent order to it, such as months (January, February, March,...), sizes (small, medium, large), or quality ratings (1-10)\n",
    "- **Nominal Data**: qualitative data where the categories don't have an inherent order or rank, such as the style of a home (colonial, ranch, contemporary, etc.)\n",
    "- **Binary Data**: a subset of qualitative data where observations fall into one of two mutually exclusive categories, such as true/false or meets standards / is defective"
